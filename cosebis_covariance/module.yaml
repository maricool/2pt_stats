explanation: |
    COSEBIs (Complete Orthogonal Sets of E/B-Integral) are a set of alternative two-point statistics 
    designed to separate E/B-modes completely on a finite angular range. They also have reasonably localised
    response to Fourier modes, ell, while also easy to measure from data.

    The expectation value of B-modes is zero if there is no B-mode power spectra. 
    To calculate B-mode COSEBIs simply switch input_section_name to take B-mode Cls as input 
    and output_section_name to avoid mixing E/B-modes.

    This module calculates both E_n and B_n log-COSEBIs from https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2136 
    and dimensionless COSEBIs from https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09774. 

    Outputs several files for the covaraince matrix. These are not passed to cosmosis block. 
    The main covariance is called after the cov_name that user defines with a .ascii file type. 

    Other covariances are calculated with the same starting name but different suffixes:
    Sigma_m covaraince using input sigma_m: *_sigma_m_*.ascii
    Sigma_m covaraince using inut cov_m: *_sigma_m_from_m_cov_*.ascii
    Non-Gaussian covaraince: *_non_Gaussian.ascii
    Theory B-mode covaraince (simple geometry): *_TheoryBn.ascii
    B-mode and also noise only covaraince term using input galaxy number of pairs: *_NoiseOnly.ascii
    Theory E-mode Gaussian covariance (simple geometry), does not input sigma_m cov: *_TheoryEn.ascii
    Cosmic variance only term (simple geometry): *_TheoryCosmicVar.ascii
    Mixed term (simple geometry): *_TheoryMixed.ascii
    Gaussian En covaraince with the correct geometry for the noise term: *_NoiseJustForNoise.ascii
